# Pewlett Hackard Analysis Challenge

## Overview of the Project
The purpose of the project is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 

## Results

- According to the retiring titles table, we can deduce that the firm will exponentially reduce costs. More than a half of the employees who are eligible to be dismiss are senior engineers and staffs, which normally their salary tend to be higher than other ones, this, for their experience. Also, this demonstrate that the firm will need to hire a lot of new engineers and staffs to replace them.

- Also, with the retirement titles and the birth date of each one, we can conclude that most of the engineers and staff who are working are considered older people with a lot of experience in the firm, so, they should be quite cautious in decide who are going to dismiss and be aware of the responsabilities that will have dismiss older people.

- Then, it is a good idea to dismiss only a part of senior engineers and staff who are eligible. In one hand, because it is necessary to start capacitating young people to the new challenges that will come in a future for the firm, and in the other hand, we need to leave a part of the senior people beacuse of their experience they had, this, more than the duration of mentor program.

- And finally, according to the first result that says that most of the people who are eligible to be dismiss have a lot of experience, the firm should pay more for their retirement which will be a lot of money, so I recommend to the firm start calculating costs since now.
